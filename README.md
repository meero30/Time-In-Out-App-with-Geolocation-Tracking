## üèóÔ∏è Overview

This system addresses critical challenges in construction workforce management by providing:
- Real-time location tracking using geo-fencing technology
- Automated payroll processing
- Cross-platform mobile and desktop applications
- Enhanced accuracy and efficiency in construction project management

## ‚ú® Key Features

### Worker Mobile Application (Android)
- **Geo-fencing Technology**: Monitors worker presence at designated worksites
- **Time Tracking**: Automated time-in/time-out with location validation
- **Overtime Management**: Request and track overtime hours
- **History Viewing**: Access past week time logs
- **Auto Timeout**: Automatic timeout when outside geofence for extended periods

### Admin Desktop Application (Windows)
- **Worker Management**: Monitor and manage workforce data
- **Payroll Processing**: Automated payroll calculations and processing
- **Site Management**: Configure job site locations and geofence parameters
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Track worker locations and status
- **Notification System**: Alerts for abnormal timeout events

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

### Mobile Application
- **Platform**: Android
- **IDE**: Android Studio
- **Language**: Kotlin
- **Location Services**: Google Play Services FusedLocationProviderClient
- **Communication**: PHP scripts via Volley

### Desktop Application
- **Platform**: Windows
- **IDE**: Visual Studio 2022
- **Framework**: WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation)
- **Language**: C#

### Backend
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Server-side**: PHP scripts
- **Communication**: RESTful API architecture


## üîß System Architecture

The system consists of three main components:
1. **Worker App**: Android mobile application for construction workers
2. **Admin App**: Windows desktop application for administrative personnel
3. **Backend Server**: MySQL database with PHP scripts for data management

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Android device with Google Play Services (for worker app)
- Windows PC (for admin app)
- MySQL database server
- PHP-enabled web server

### Installation
*Note: Detailed installation instructions would be provided based on deployment requirements*

## üì± System Requirements

### Worker App
- Android device with Google Play Services
- GPS capability
- Internet connectivity (WiFi or mobile data)
- Minimum storage: 32GB recommended

### Admin App
- Windows operating system
- .NET Framework support
- Network connectivity to database server

## üß™ Testing Phases

The system underwent comprehensive testing:
- **Alpha Testing**: Internal developer environment testing
- **Beta Testing**: Field testing with 10 construction workers
- **Final Testing**: Performance optimization and user acceptance testing

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations

- Limited compatibility with Huawei devices (due to Google Play Services dependency)
- Battery consumption optimization not fully implemented
- Requires stable internet connection for real-time synchronization
